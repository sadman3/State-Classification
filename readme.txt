I have implemented the project in pytorch.

Before testing the code, put the test_anonymous folder in the data/test directory. Right now that directory is empty. 

Then use the command: "python3 test.py". It will create a file named "sadman_result.json".


If you want to run the code for training. Put the training and validation images in data/train and data/valid folders. Then run the command "python3 train.py"
